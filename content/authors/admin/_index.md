I am a Lead Data Scientist at Nuveen investments focusing on solving demand-forecasting related problems with statistics, machine learning, and deep learning. I have strong interests in artificial intelligence and programming, having completed a Master of Science in Analytics at the University of Chicago. In my free time, I enjoy running, photography, and reading. I have finished two Chicago marathons and three half marathons. I hope to run the Chicago marathon again in 2020.
